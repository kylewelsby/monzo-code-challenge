✔ Start repository for Code Challenge @started(23-05-24 09:10) @done(23-05-24 09:20) @lasted(10m00s)
✔ Research a cli interface with deno @started(23-05-24 09:20) @done(23-05-24 09:30) @lasted(30m00s)
  - https://examples.deno.land/command-line-arguments
  I will use `Deno.args` to get the arguments passed to the cli.
  I have additional room to use flags to accept optons or modifiers if needed.
✔ Research methods concurrency executing scripts with Deno @started(23-05-24 09:40) @done(23-05-24 09:44) @lasted(4m15s)
  Theres a concept in Deno that allow the runtime to launch [workers](https://deno.com/manual@v1.33.4/runtime/workers) on different threads.
  Ths might be useful to crawl inner pages and spread the load to different thread on the machine.
✔ Write a simple script to fetch the hyperlinks found on a page @started(23-05-24 09:44) @done(23-05-24 10:16) @lasted(32m4s)
✔ Expand the simple script to crawl deeper into the site @started(23-05-24 10:16) @done(23-05-24 10:58) @lasted(42m15s)
  Ensure the script is not crawling the same page twice
  Handle recursive scraping of the website
☐ Refactor the code, cleaning and adding comments
  - Add comments to the code
  - Refactor the code to be more readable
  - Add a .github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml file to the repository
